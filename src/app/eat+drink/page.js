    The  shed restaurant is divided into restaurant and a wine bar; a small interpretation centre of the grass yard and a small garden with a granite fountain; a dining room for up 80 people, a porch where 60 people can be seated; and an outdoor space, ornamented with the typical vegetation, surrounded by the garden and olive groves that wrap the property, where is also possible to hold events.

    You have at your disposal a service made and served by a surprisingly young team. The signature cuisine of our Chef and his team is characterized by the beautifully balanced flavours and textures, the vibrant colours, and the use of fresh high-quality products that meet the wines produced in the region and across the oceans, culminating in a meal designed to surprise and satisfy the expectations of its guests.

    <p>
    The menus from our Chef reveal comprehensive conjugations of flavours, together with the regional and local gastronomy, but also our selection of our wines gives the food its own identity.
